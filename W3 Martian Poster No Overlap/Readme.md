<h1>W3 Martian Poster</h1>

For this week's assignment, we are to show our take on "The Martian" poster. The Martian is a movie/book telling a story of a stranded astronaut on Martian soil. 

The idea of this poster kept on changing over time, from the idea of having a person standing in the middle of a vast Martian desert to what it is now, two planets (Earth and Mars) of different sizes, showing the contrast and distance between the two planets. 

This poster is generated by p5.js code such that each generation of it shows the planets in different sizes and position without overlapping.
