<h1>W2 Wet and Sharp</h1>

For this week's assignment, we were to represent "wet and sharp" with the shapes learnt in week 2. Unlike last week, I tried to refrain from using hard numbers and if I do use hard numbers, attach it to a variable that I can repeatedly call.

The initial idea for this week's assignment was to make rows of diamonds that slowly transforms into a water droplet by the end of the row. However, I couldn't really figure out how to repeat the diamond shape (hint: I later found out how to do this after I finished my assignment). While I was researching how to draw repeated shapes, I figured I could just make a bunch of triangles (I don't know why I forgot that diamond shape really is just 1 vertex away from a triangle) and while looking at it, I thought of actual diamonds. And since the theme for this week is "wet and sharp", I thought of.....

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0450259/">Blood Diamond</a> is one of my dad's favourite movies, so I naturally thought of it.

When writing the code, I actually wrote down all the hard numbers. After that, I went through the code to see if I could simplify them and which numbers I could turn into variables and how to loop them with for loops. The process took a while, especially because I'm not exactly used to this, but in the end, I could say that I came out feeling like I've learnt something.

I'm sure there are a thousand more effective ways of programming this design, but I think I'm rather satisfied that at least I <em>somehow </em>moved away from the serious offence of doing the maths in my head (instead of in the code) like I did last week. Moreover, I'm also kinda worried that the design won't scream "blood diamond!", because colours could really help sometimes.

All in aaaalll, I look forward to adding colours (and code better) soon!

Cheers!
